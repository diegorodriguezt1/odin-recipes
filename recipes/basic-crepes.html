    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. 
    It's made from <strong>ingredients that everyone has on hand.</strong></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. 
            Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. 
            Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <p><li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. 
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
            Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li></p>
